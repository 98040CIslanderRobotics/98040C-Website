      <h1>(When the sun sets)</h1>
      <p>Red sun, red sun over paradise
Red sun, red sun over paradise</p>
      <p>Golden rays of the glorious sunshine
Sending down such a blood-red light</p>
      <p>Now, the animals slowly retreat to the shadows, out of sight</p>
      <p>Arid winds blow across the mountains
Giving flight to the birds of prey</p>
      <p>In the distance machines come to transform Eden, day by day</p>
      <p>Only love is with us now
Something warm and pure
Find the peace within ourselves
No need for a cure</p>
      <p>When the wind is slow, when the fire's hot
The vulture waits to see what rots</p>
      <p>Oh, how pretty, all the scenery
This is nature's sacrifice</p>
      <p>When the air blows through with a brisk attack
The reptile tail ripped from its back</p>
      <p>When the sun sets, we will not forget the</p>
      <h2>Red sun over paradise</h2?
        <h3>Red Sun</h3>
