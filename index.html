  <body>This site is entirely barebones. No, really. there are only 4 lines of code on all of it, and no CSS of any kind.
  this website is dedicated to my work and projects, along with hazardfall itself. expect stuff here in the future, maybe.
  While there's nothing here, allow me to introduce myself. I'm The Pyro, or just Pyro. I'm a spriter, terraria modder, and programmer. I live in Washington state.
  If you see this site, you probably got redirected here from my discord bio, or something. see you around! </body>
