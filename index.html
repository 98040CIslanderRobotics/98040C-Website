      <h2>What is this website?
<p>Hazardfall.com is a domain I registered for 3 reasons. 1: publictize my projects. 2: create a website for the hazardfall game studio. 3: to have in my discord about me. </p>

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>I'm hazardfall games co-owner, The Pyro, but you should just say Pyro. I'm a big fan of Doom, Terraria, Cuphead, Touhou Project,and more. I like anime and manga, generally. I play a lot of games, generally difficult games. If you see this?, you probably already know me. See you around!</p>
