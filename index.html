                <h2>What is Hazardfall?</h2>
                    <p>Hazardfall, or HF, for short, is a games studio based in Leeds, England and Washington, USA. We are currently on hiatus. Although this site IS named after the studio, it is not a studio site. This is a personal site for me, Pyro.</p>
                <h3>Who am I?</h3> 
                    <p>I'm The Pyro, but you should just say Pyro. I'm a big fan of Doom, Terraria, Cuphead, Touhou Project,and more. I like anime and manga, generally. I play a lot of games, generally difficult games. If you see this?, you probably already know me.</p>
