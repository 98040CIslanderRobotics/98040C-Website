  <body><h2>What is this site?</h2>This is hazardfall.com, which you already know. what this site is, is a place for me to share my projects, work, and more. Here you will find download links, source codes, forums (whenever I find out how to do that) and more.</p>

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>I'm The Pyro, but you should call me Pyro. I am a programmer, (on hiatus) game developer, and terraria mod developer. I enjoy games, especially bullet hells (https://steamcommunity.com/id/Th3Pyr0/) and have fun in difficult games. I also like other things, like some mangas or animes, shows, and Touhou Project (yes this gets its own entry.) If you're on this site, 80% chance you already know me. in that case, I'll see you around!> </p>
