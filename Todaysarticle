                <h2>ALL Kids Should Learn Tech!</h2>
                <p>Coming to you from our writer, Z'ev, we have to announce that "all students should officially learn tech". We've officially made this conclusion after various views of different schools. Our examples include elementary and middle schools throughout the united states of america. Among these schools, the 5% that didn't use technology had on average 40% less learning succeess an 10% lower average student IQs. However, in the 95 that did, it had above average IQs and a 10% above average student success rate, along with 20% above average grades. With all this information, we can safely assum "All Kids Should Learrn Tech."</p>
