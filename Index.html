            <h1>Message to you.</h1>
                <h2>You probably aren't him.</h2>
                    <p>This is targetted at one person. I will not bring up names, but if you're him, know that this is for you. Hi, it's me, Pyro. I'm Sorry. I went off on my own, too cocky, and now this has happened. In the end it is my fault, isn't it. I know its unlikely you'll see this, but we made hazardfall together, so it's my only hope at it. I miss you.</p>
    <p>We had some nice times together, 21 through 22. if this is it, I won't forget you. There's a good chance you'll never see me again, and that this website is the cause.</p>
    <p>You're just as smart as me.Hell, it's why we got along so well. For what this website took? It was 7 bucks and some copy and pasting. I gotta tell ya, css and html is the easiest crap. I'll list all my source code here, for you.</p>
    <p>There are so many things ive done wrong, so many possible causes. I screwed up. I owe it to you. everything. so, thank you.</p>
<p>Goodbye. </p>
<p>https://github.com/Th3Pyr0/th3pyr0.github.io my source code is here. BTW, discord is same, The Pyro#1984, if you ever want to message me again.</p>
