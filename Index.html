                    <p>This is targetted at one person. I will not bring up names, but if you're him, know that this is for you. Hi, it's me, Pyro. I'm Sorry. I went off on my own, too cocky, and now this has happened. In the end it is my fault, isn't it. I know its unlikely you'll see this, but we made hazardfall together, so it's my only hope at it. I miss you. Goodbye. </p>
